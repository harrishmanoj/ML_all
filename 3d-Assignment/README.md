Step 1) Run all the first six blocks in that order

Step 2) The 7th block contains the promp you want to generate. Change it accordingly.

Step 3)After 130 iterations run the next block which will show a small preview

Step 4)We use Point-e by open AI so the genereated files are not .obj hence to convert them run the next block

Step 5)If you want to download the .obj and .stl run the last block that's it.

Use google collab and also use GPU for Run Time for faster Iterations.
